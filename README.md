# CS5787-DeepLearning-Assignment1

This project demonstrates how to train and test the LeNet-5 model with various regularization techniques on the FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch. The regularization techniques evaluated are:

- No Regularization
- Dropout
- Weight Decay
- Batch Normalization

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib (for plotting)
- pandas (for summarizing results)

## Setup
